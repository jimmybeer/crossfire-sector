# Project Workspace

## Purpose
- Codex agent workspace utilities and scripts for working with the Godot project in this repo.

## Contents
- `.codex/` – Agent guidance, tooling contract, and helper scripts (`setup.sh`, `fix_indent.sh`, `TOOLS.md`, `FAQ.md`).

## Notes
- Follow `.codex/AGENTS.md` for Godot/GDScript/C# indentation, linting, and validation loops.
- Avoid adding binaries; prefer text-based assets compatible with Godot and source control.
