# Architecture

## Purpose
- Captures the system architecture for the Crossfire Sector digital adaptation, keeping design traceable to requirements and ready for future online play.

## Files
- `architecture.md` – High-level and low-level architecture, module breakdowns, and change log.
- `tech-stack.md` – Chosen stack and evaluated alternatives; preserve content below the ignore marker.
- `agents.md` – Persona rules for architecture edits.

## Notes
- Maintain the mandated section order in `architecture.md` when updating.
- Keep requirement IDs (GR/DA/CP/AQ/MP) visible in rationale and traceability.
