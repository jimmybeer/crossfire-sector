# Crossfire Sector © By ULC Battle Reports

## Basics
- 2-player tactical skirmish game on a 15×9 grid battlefield.
- Randomly set up 3–5 pieces of terrain (size of 1–4 squares).
- Each player fields 5 units from one of 5 unique factions.
- Only a few d6 needed (2–3). (d6 means a 6-sided dice)
- The game lasts 6 rounds.

## Unit Stats
- **Move** – How many squares a unit can move (diagonal movement is allowed).
- **Range** – Max shoot distance in squares (excluding shooting unit and including target square).
- **Attack Quality (AQ)** – Modifier to attack rolls.
- **Defense** – Target number to beat on 2d6 + AQ (+1 if in cover).

## Deployment & Activation System
- Both sides deploy at the same time. All units deploy in their home zone. Units must be deployed in at least 2 of the 3 rows.
- At the start of each round, both players roll 1d6 for initiative (re-roll ties).
- Initiative winner chooses:
  - Activate first, but can only activate 1 unit.
  - Let opponent activate first with 1 unit.
- After the first activation, the players then alternate activating 2 units at a time.
- Each player may activate up to 4 units per round.
- If fewer than 5 units remain, all may activate.

## Unit Actions (Only 1 per activation)
- **Move** – Up to full Move stat.
- **Attack** – Move up to half Move (rounded up), then Shoot or Melee.
- **First aid** – Move up to half Move (rounded up), then aid a down unit.
- **Hold Position** – Do nothing.  
  A Down unit that receives first aid can activate immediately after.

## Combat Rules
- Ranged attacks are resolved with **2d6**. The attacker picks a target in line of sight (LoS). LoS is a straight line from unit to target and is blocked by both friendly & enemy units.
- If the total + AQ > target’s Defense → **Target Down**.
- Melee is performed when a unit moves to a square next to an enemy unit. Both units roll d6 at the same time and add AQ. The unit with the lowest roll is Down. If it’s a tie, nothing will happen.
- **Critical hit (Ranged):** Double sixes before AQ → instant kill.
- When a target is Down, it cannot activate unless a friendly unit moves to a square next to it and performs first aid.
- To destroy a Down unit, an enemy unit must make a melee attack action, but no dice roll is needed — or hit with a second ranged attack.
- **Critical Failure (Ranged):** Double ones will hit a friendly unit if the shot is aimed at an enemy in base contact with the friendly unit.

## Mission Types
Choose or roll for mission. If a mission is tied at the end of round 6 — play a 7th round.

| # | Type | Objective |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | Crossfire Clash | Score 1 point per kill. Most points win. |
| 2 | Control Center | Most units in the center zone (grid 7–9). |
| 3 | Break Through | Get more units into opponent’s zone. |
| 4 | Dead Center | Control the exact center square. |
| 5 | Dead Zone | Prevent any enemy units in center zone (grid 7–9). |
| 6 | Occupy | Control the most of the 4 sectors with at least one unit (split battlefield into 4 equally sized sectors). |

## Terrain & Cover
- Each game includes 4–5 pieces of terrain (2–4 square size) that can block LoS and/or give Cover.
- **Cover:** If 50%+ of a unit is hidden by terrain, it gains **+1 Defense**.

## Campaign Mode — *Operation Crossfire*
- A campaign is **1d3 + 2** battles (3–5 total). Players keep the same faction throughout.
- At the start of each battle, randomly choose a new mission from the 6 listed. Each mission must be unique — no repeats.
