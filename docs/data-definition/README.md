# Data Definition

## Purpose
- Governs schemas and entity relationships for rules, missions, factions, campaigns, and persistence to keep the engine deterministic and data-driven.

## Files
- `data-dictionary.md` – Canonical schemas with per-entity sections, versioning, migration notes, and traceability.
- `agents.md` – Persona guidance for data-model edits.

## Notes
- Maintain the linked table of contents and per-entity section format when adding or changing entities.
- Align schema updates with requirements and architecture documents; include migration notes for any structural shifts.
